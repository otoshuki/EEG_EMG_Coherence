# Hybrid BCI System
## This project was done as my 2nd year summer intern
### Only the programs I worked on has been added here.
### The work on KPLS and KPLS-mRMR hasn't been added since I didn't create it or hold the rights.

The project was on developing a hybrid BCI system that uses both EEG and EMG signals for classifying forearm state(open or closed). This information would've been used as a control signal for a bionic arm.
